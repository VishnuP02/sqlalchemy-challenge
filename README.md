For this challenge, I completed a climate analysis about Honolulu, Hawaii. This challenge is broken up into two parts:
  - Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
      - In this section, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. Specifically, I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
  - Part 2: Design Your Climate App
      - In this section, I designed a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed.

Resources used to complete challenge:
  - Lecture slides, class recordings, stackoverflow, and AskBCS session with LA Sunshine Data
